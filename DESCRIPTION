Description: A regularization method for the cumulative link models.
    The 'smooth-effect-on-response penalty' ('SERP') provides flexible 
    modelling of the ordinal model by enabling the smooth transition 
    from the general cumulative link model to a coarser form of the 
    same model. In other words, as the tuning parameter goes from 
    zero to infinity, the subject-specific effects associated with 
    each variable in the model tend to a unique global effect. The 
    parameter estimates of the general cumulative model are mostly 
    unidentifiable or at least only identifiable within a range of 
    the entire parameter space. Thus, by maximizing a penalized 
    rather than the usual non-penalized log-likelihood, this and 
    other numerical problems common with the general model are to 
    a large extent eliminated. Fitting is via a modified Newton's 
    method. Several standard model performance and descriptive 
    methods are also available.
