Description: Implements a regularization method for cumulative link models using the 
    Smooth-Effect-on-Response Penalty (SERP). This method allows flexible 
    modeling of ordinal data by enabling a smooth transition from a general 
    cumulative link model to a simplified version of the same model. As the 
    tuning parameter increases from zero to infinity, the subject-specific 
    effects for each variable converge to a single global effect. 
    The approach addresses common issues in cumulative link models, such as 
    parameter unidentifiability and numerical instability, by maximizing a 
    penalized log-likelihood instead of the standard non-penalized version. 
    Fitting is performed using a modified Newton's method. Additionally, the 
    package includes various model performance metrics and descriptive tools.
