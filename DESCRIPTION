Description: A regularization method for the cumulative link models (CLM). With  
            the 'smooth-effect-on-response penalty' (SERP), a smooth transition
            is made from the general cumulative model with subject-specific 
            effects to a coarser form of the same model, resulting to global 
            effects within categories of the general model. By maximizing 
            a serp penalized log-likelihood rather than the usual non-penalized
            likelihood, the problem of model unidentifiability, for instance,
            common in the cumulative ordinal models is reversed. Moreover, in 
            situations were the general cumulative model suffers convergence 
            failure SERP is bound to succeed.
