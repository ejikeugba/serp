Description: A regularization method for the cumulative link models (CLM). The  
        'smooth-effect-on-response penalty' (SERP) provides flexible modelling
        of ordinal models by enabling a smooth transition from the general
        cumulative link model (GCLM) with subject-specific effects to a coarser
        form of the same model, resulting in global effects within the categories
        of GCLM. The parameter estimates of GCLMs are mostly unidentifiable or 
        at best, only identifiable within a range of the entire parameter space. 
        Thus, by maximizing a SERP penalized log-likelihood rather than the usual 
        non-penalized log-likelihood, this and other forms of numerical problems 
        common with the general model are addressed. Fitting is via a modified 
        Newton-Raphson algorithm. Several standard model performance and 
        descriptive methods are also available.
