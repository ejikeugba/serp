Smooth Effects on Response Penalty for CLM

A regularization method for the cumulative link models (CLM). The 'serp' function applies the 'smooth-effect-on-response penalty' (SERP) on the estimates of the general CLM, causing all subject-specific effects associated with each variable in the model to shrink towards a unique global effect. Fitting is done using a modified Newton's method. Several standard model performance and descriptive methods are also available. See [Ugba et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/stats4030037) and [Tutz and Gertheiss, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X16642560) for more details.


## Example
Consider the cumulative logit model of the wine dataset, where the rating of wine bitterness is predicted with the two treatment factors, temperature and contact.

```R
## The unpenalized non-proportional odds model returns unbounded estimates, hence,
## not fully identifiable.
f1 <- serp(rating ~ temp + contact, slope = "unparallel",
           reverse = TRUE, link = "logit", data = wine)
coef(f1)
```

```R
## The penalized non-proportional odds model with a user-supplied lambda gives 
## a fully identified model with bounded estimates. A suitable tuning criterion
## could as well be used to select lambda (e.g., cv) 
f2 <- serp(rating ~ temp + contact, slope = "penalize",
           link = "logit", reverse = TRUE, tuneMethod = "user",
           lambda = 1e1 ,data = wine)
coef(f2)
```

```R
## A penalized partial proportional odds model with one variable set to 
## global effect is also possible.
f3 <- serp(rating ~ temp + contact, slope = "penalize",
           reverse = TRUE, link = "logit", tuneMethod = "user",
           lambda = 2e1, globalEff = ~ temp, data = wine)
coef(f3)
```

```R
## The unpenalized proportional odds model with constrained estimates. Using a 
## very strong lambda in f2 will result in estimates equal to estimates in f4.
f4 <-  serp(rating ~ temp + contact, slope = "parallel",
            reverse = FALSE, link = "logit", data = wine)
summary(f4)
```
