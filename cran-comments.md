This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* included in the  description field a reference to the methods used in the package 
* supplied the missing values to all exported methods with more explanations
* disabled \dontrun{} to allow all examples run automatically 
* dropped all occurrences of <<- in the package functions 
* improved on package test coverage
* updated READmE.md and news.md
* ran all required tests and checks
