This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* included a reference to methods used in the package in the  description field
* added values to all exported methods with corresponding explanations too
* allowed all examples to run by having all \dontrun{} removed
* dropped all occurrences of <<- in the functions 
* improved on general test coverage
* updated READmE.md and news.md
* ran all required tests and checks
